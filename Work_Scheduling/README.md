# Problem Statement

A call center requires a certain number of agents at various times of the day depending on the
anticipated volume of calls, as shown in the table below. There are five possible combinations of
the various time periods that constitute an eight-hour shift that have been agreed upon between
the union and management as being acceptable shifts. These are reflected in the first table below
by the checks is the column for each of the five shifts and, also, described in another manner in
the second table. The first table also shows that number of agents required over the 24 hours of a
day in various two-hour and four-hour time periods, as well as the per-agent wages cost for
assigning an agent to each of the feasible shifts. The shifts that are less preferred carry additional
cost in terms of what is called “shift premium.”

How many agents should be assigned to each feasible shift in order to minimize staffing cost?

# Objective

This project aimed to find the minimum cost of employing enough call center agents in order to serve as many clients as possible for each shift and each time period.
