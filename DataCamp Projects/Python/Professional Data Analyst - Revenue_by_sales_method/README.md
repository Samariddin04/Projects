# Data Viz1 
As we see it here, it looks like there might be missing data in-between some areas like 70-80, 160-170 and 200-220 bins are really low or no transactions at all for this area, which shows there are less data or these areas might be the borders for the data meaning some factors are separating the data into multiple sectors. Furthermore, there are many transactions which revenues are less than 240. The most of the transactions has been 80-90 bin with about 2500 transactions, while most of the other transactions were made between 90 to 110 and 40 to 60 as well.

# Data Viz2 
As we see above, for each sales_method revenues were different: Call - starting from about 25 to 70 Email - starting from around 75 to 150 Email + Call - starting from about 125 to 240

Then, in reality there is difference between revenues of each sales_method and sales_method is dividing the revenues data into 3 categories!

# Data Viz3 
Overall view is showing that revenues for each sales_methods got increased by time and during the weeks at least the average revenue doubled for each sales_method.

I guess as much more specific data we have, that much more detailed research and recommendation we can give, while here most useful data probably is the count of transactions by sales_method and the average revenue by sales_method.

According to all the data, I suggest to use more Email + Call sales_method. As it is causing to get more revenue and it does not take too much effort. Furthermore, it is better to keep Email is also as a side option. Because it does not take as much time and effort as the other 2 options, while it caused second biggest average revenue from sales_methods. Maybe, it is better to send emails always and give calls after some time, that actually gives a client to learn about the product more, to know the product rather than directly calling and having difficulty to explain everything in the first time while customer also do not always understand it perfectly which causes less revenue.
