There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\n\nbest_math = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>=640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]]\nbest_math_schools = best_math.sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\nschools[\"total_SAT\"]=schools[\"average_math\"]+schools[\"average_reading\"]+schools[\"average_writing\"]\ntop_schools = schools.sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False)\ntop_10_schools = top_schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].head(10)\ntop_10_schools\n\nimport numpy as np\nschools\n\ngroup_borough = schools.groupby(\"borough\")\n# group_borough[\"num_schools\"] = schools[\"borough\"].value_counts()\n# group_borough[\"average_SAT\"] = group_borough[\"total_SAT\"].mean()\nstd = group_borough[\"total_SAT\"].std()\nmean = group_borough[\"total_SAT\"].mean()\nnum_school = group_borough.size()\n\nmax_std_borough = std.idxmax()\n\n# Create a DataFrame with the required information\nlargest_std_dev = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"borough\": [max_std_borough],\n    \"num_schools\": [num_school[max_std_borough]],\n    \"average_SAT\": [mean[max_std_borough]],\n    \"std_SAT\": [std[max_std_borough]]\n})\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.round(2)\nbest_math_schools\n\n# max_std = std.max()\n# largest = std[std==max_std]\n# #
