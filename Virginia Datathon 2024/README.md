# Project
The Virginia Datathon is a yearly statewide competition focused around a central theme. This year, we were tasked with finding ways to boost the Virginia workforce. Over the course of a week, we used 8 datasets
from the Virginia Open Data Portal to extract the most useful features in predicting labor force participation. We were selected as finalists and won the People's Choice Award at the in-person conference 
in Richmond, VA.
