## Flight Delay Analysis & Prediction Using PySpark, Pandas, and H2O
Analyzed 10 years of flight data by integrating large datasets using PySpark for scalable transformation and preprocessing. Converted the refined dataset to Pandas for in-depth exploratory analysis and visualized results using Matplotlib. Leveraged H2O's Random Forest classifier to identify significant factors contributing to flight delays and to build a predictive model.
Key analyses included:

* Normalized Delay Metrics: Calculated average departure delays per airline, normalized by flight volume to fairly assess reliability across carriers.

* Route Delay Analysis: Identified problematic origin-destination pairs by ranking average delays, enabling route-specific insights.

* Performance Metrics by Airline: Computed and visualized probabilities of delay and cancellation to evaluate airline reliability.

* Predictive Modeling: Trained a random forest model with H2O to predict potential delays using historical flight features.

This end-to-end project enabled data-driven insights for airlines, travelers, and stakeholders by highlighting delay patterns, problematic routes, and offering predictive capabilities.
