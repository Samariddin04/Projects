# Projects

**ðŸ“Š Welcome to My Data & Analytics Portfolio!**

Hi there! I'm Samariddin Zarifov, and this GitHub repository showcases a collection of projects I developed during my Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at William & Mary, as well as personal projects I completed through DataCamp and independent learning.

This portfolio reflects my journey in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems using tools such as **Python**, **SQL**, **R**, **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and cloud platforms like **AWS** and **GCP**. The projects span topics like:

*Exploratory data analysis & visualization*

*Predictive modeling & machine learning*

*Time series forecasting*

*Optimization & operations research*

*Data engineering & ETL pipelines*

*Business intelligence dashboards*

Real-world case studies in finance, healthcare, marketing, and logistics

Each project folder includes a README file with context, objectives, methodologies used, and key insights. I believe in writing clean, well-documented code and turning data into actionable insights.

Thanks for visiting â€” feel free to explore the projects, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samar-zarif/)
