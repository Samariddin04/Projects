By highlighting the distribution of billionaires, showcasing their diverse backgrounds, and emphasizing the importance of being a self-starter, we aim to inspire and inform our audience about the pathways to success.

The primary objective of our presentation is to highlight the distribution of billionaires, showcase their diverse backgrounds, and exemplify the need for becoming a self-starter. We aim to transform complex data into intuitive visual narratives that reveal patterns and trends in global wealth.

# The Data

Before delving into the creation of models, our team analyzed the Billionaires Statistics Dataset. Crucial variables such as *rank*, *final net worth*, *age*, *country of residence*, *industries*, *business category*, and *country of citizenship* provided a comprehensive understanding of the billionaire landscape. In comparing these variables, patterns began to emerge. Noteworthy conclusions include the observation that most billionaires fall within the age range of their mid-50s to 60s, with a significant concentration of billionaires in the technology sector in the United States, especially in New York and California. Furthermore, a compelling trend unfolded as different countries exhibited varying percentages of billionaires in distinct industries, exemplified by the prevalence of tech billionaires in the USA and fashion moguls in France. Moreover, the data revealed that over 70% of billionaires are self-made, reinforcing the significance of individual initiative in attaining billionaire status.
